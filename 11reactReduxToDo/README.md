Will need to install @reduxjs/toolkit as well as react-redux.
Redux is an independent library in itself but will need react-redux to use it with react. 

Then to configure store, make app folder in src then make store.js

Then configure Reducers, we name that file with "Slice" word, just a naming convention.
features folder can make many features like todo, login, etc.
make features folder > todo > todoSlice.js
